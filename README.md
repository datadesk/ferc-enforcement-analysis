The _Los Angeles Times_ conducted an analysis of civil penalties issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the Dec. 14, 2017 story ["Why Wall Street gets a cut of your California power bill."](http://www.latimes.com/projects/a-fi-electricity-capacity-investments/)

It found that federal regulators have assessed $1.6 billion in penalties against traders, banks, utilities, power producers and grid operators for various violations since anti-manipulation laws were enacted by Congress in 2005. More than a third of the assessed penalties have been tied to Californiaâ€™s energy market.

The results can be reproduced in the [analysis notebook](02_analysis.ipynb) found in this repository.
